# sdss_pycecream
Example scripts for running pycecream fits to sdss light curves in batch

### test_pycecream.py
See here for a template on reading in sdss light curves saved in the folder structure
specified in `example_data`. Note all targets in here are actually just duplicates of the `rm005` data that are simply 
duplicated for illustrative purposes.

There is no need to divide all the targets into the `groupx` structure shown here.
To run in series you could just dump all the sdss targets into the `group1` folder,
in the form of 1 folder per target with each folder containing the light curve files
with the naming convention specified.

Hope this template helps. Feel free to add to it or improve however needed.
